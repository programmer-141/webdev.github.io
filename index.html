            <p class="sectiontag text-big">HTML</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
            for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
            into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
            included cues for the appearance of the document.
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other 
            objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to
            create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
            lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle 
            brackets. Tags such as < img /> and < input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other 
            tags such as < p > surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags a
            s sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of 
            the page.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">ascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for 
                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, 
                colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility
                and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to
                share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexit
                y and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to
                improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page 
                in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice 
                (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate 
                formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">JAVASCRIPT</p> 
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language 
                that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time 
                compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based objec
                t-orientation, and first-class functions.Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
                technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential
                part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,
                and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.As a multi-paradig
                m language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
                It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular 
                expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the 
                language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or 
                graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.</p>
